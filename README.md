# RxJMessage
[![Carthage Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

This library is a thin wrapper around __JMessage__ ( [JMessage Docs](https://docs.jiguang.cn/jmessage/client/im_sdk_ios/) ).

## Example app

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

This library depends on both __RxSwift__ and __JMessage__ 3.5.0+.

#### CocoaPods

RxJMessage requires CocoaPods 1.1.x or higher.

RxJMessage is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "RxJMessage"
```

#### Carthage

To integrate RxRealm into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "dengyhgit/RxJMessage"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `RxJMessage.framework` into your Xcode project.

## TODO

* Test add platforms and add compatibility for the pod
